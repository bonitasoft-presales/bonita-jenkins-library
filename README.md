# Bonita Jenkins Shared Library

This repository provides a [Shared Library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) for Bonita Continuous Delivery (BCD) pipelines with [Jenkins automation server](https://jenkins.io/).

Its first purpose is to provide a `bcd` step by extending the Jenkins Pipeline DSL. Follow this [BCD integration tutorial](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bcd/2.0/jenkins_example) that shows how to use this shared library for your BCD pipelines in Jenkins.
